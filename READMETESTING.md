<a name="considerations"></a>

## 1.1 Considerations

* Testing has been based on a minimum size of an iPhone SE and a maximum width of 1440px as per my mentorâ€™s advice. Custom CSS has been created to accommodate multiple screen sizes

* HTML code has been validated using <a href="https://validator.w3.org/" target="_blank">W3C Markup Validation Service</a>

* CSS code has been validated using <a href="https://jigsaw.w3.org/CSS-validator//" target="_blank">W3C CSS Validation Service</a>

* Javascript code has been validated using <a href="https://jshint.com/" target="_blank">JS Hint</a>

* Site response has been validated using <a href="http://ami.responsivedesign.is/" target="_blank">Am I Responsive</a>

* The website was sent to my partner and friend for general use/testing
