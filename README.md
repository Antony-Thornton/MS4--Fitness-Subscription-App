# CHANGE NAME
## Introduction
Welcome to my fourth project. This project is a simple online Fitness Subscription Application that allows users to manage their own recipes remotely. This will use languages such as Django, Python, HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

This project will show the use of CRUD functionality (Create, Read, Update, Delete). The user will be able create, read, update and delete their user profile.

A live website can be found <a href="" target="_blank">here</a>.

It is really important to include responsive design in this project as many users are using different devices (mobile, tablet, laptop/PC). This gives the user the best experience on their device.

* Responsive on all device sizes
* Easy navigation through labelled buttons
* All elements will be consistent including font size, font family, colour scheme.

# 2. Features
#### [Go To Top](#table-of-contents "Go To Top")

## Navigation

* The navigation bar has two layouts. One view for a desktop and the other for mobile.

* The desktop view uses a traditional layout utilising materialisecss default navigation. The user should clearly find all navigational pages at the top right.

* As with the desktop view the mobile uses existing CSS code but compresses the links into a collapsible element at the top right. The user should be able to open the element and see all the available links.

## Home Page

* The home page is the main landing page for the site. When the user visits the page, they should be able to understand what the website is about and what it can offer them.
* The page presents information as its primary feature.
